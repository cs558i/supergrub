The primary purpose of Super GRUB2 Disk is to help you boot into an OS whose bootloader is broken.
Second, and almost as important, is to be a tool to learn more about GRUB2 and the booting process.

This is Super Grub2 Disk, the second version of the Super Grub Disk..
Super Grub2 Disk is rewritten from scratch to make Super Grub Disk cleaner, safer, more
robust, more powerful, and more portable.
